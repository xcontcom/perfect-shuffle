# 🧠 Perfect Shuffle Fractals

These aren't your average fractals.

What you see here is the result of a brutally simple idea:
> Take a tiny grid, and recursively expand it using fixed spatial permutations.

No randomness.  
No equations.  
Just pure, symbolic structure — repeated through perfect, rule-based subdivision.

And the result?  
Fractals that look like logic itself folding in on itself.

### ⚙️ What's going on?

This system starts with a `2×2` binary grid. On each iteration:
- The grid doubles in size
- Each `2×2` block is filled based on the current rule set
- These rules are just **perfect shuffles** — deterministic rearrangements of pixel positions

You can think of each rule as a *spatial bitwise operation*.  
The result is a massive, recursively structured pattern, built from nothing but clean logic.

### 🔥 Why it's crazy cool

- **Perfect self-similarity** — no noise, no decay
- **Recursive logic** — every pixel is a decision made by a rule, not a formula
- **Unreasonably expressive** — despite the rules being tiny integers (`0–15`), the patterns explode into complexity
- **Visual proofs** — each image is a pure mathematical artifact

These aren't just visualizations. They're **symbolic systems unfolding**.  
They're the cousin of cellular automata and convolutional networks — but sharper, more discrete, and infinitely interpretable.

### 🧪 TL;DR

You are looking at:
- Recursive permutations
- Lossless symbolic expansion
- Fractal geometry with digital DNA

This is the cleanest chaos you’ll ever see.

More coming soon (including the full article translation).
